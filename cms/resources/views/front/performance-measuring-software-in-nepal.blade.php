          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Ways to measure sales performance</p>

          <p>There's no job in the world that can't be measured. One of the most obvious ways to <strong><a
                  href="{{ route('measure-sales-performance') }}">measure sales performance</a></strong> has always
            centered around calculating the revenue that representatives generate. For sales managers, revenue,
            profitability, and market share are considered to be the most important sales performance metrics.
            Organizations are constantly debating on other metrics that can help in determining the success and effort
            of a sales representative, including things like a number of calls, meetings, emails, and other customer
            communications.</p>

          <p>Revenue is not the only metric that sales managers should pay attention to. Being too focused on making
            sales or quota makes them forget, that there are other valuable performance metrics to be focused on,
            especially if a good sales representative is having a bad month.</p>

          <p>When you are thinking about the<strong><a href="{{ route('measure-sales-performance') }}"> measures of
                sales performance</a></strong>, you also need to focus on the activity, conduct process and result.
            There are several ways to measure sales performance:
          <p>

                acquired, etc
              </li>

                rate is the single most powerful way to increase revenue

          <p>To <strong><a href="{{ route('measure-sales-performance') }}">measure a sales performance</a></strong>, you
            need to improve your sales team’s performance by tracking and analyzing the right metrics.
          <p>

          <div class="col-sm-12">
            <ul class="list">
              <li><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> A salesman must know on using the measurement metrics and
                performance
              </li>

            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Before you evaluate the performance of the sales team, you must first analyze its components. Below is the
            simple formula to evaluate sales performance:</p>

          <p style="text-align:center;font-size: 20px;">Performance = Capability + Motivation + Opportunity</p>

          <p>Field sales is a challenge while in modern-day consumers and clients are becoming more aware of
            technologies, digitizing your field sales pitching effort is more than mandatory. To grow revenues and
            manage sales teams effectively, sales managers must carefully measure the performance of individual sales
            representatives.</p>

                app</a></strong> is to evaluate the sales performance of the salesman. If you evaluate sales performance
            regularly with a CRM tool, you can analyze vast improvements in your sales organization. But. there should
            be defined metrics in order to make any kind of evaluation for sales performance.</p>
